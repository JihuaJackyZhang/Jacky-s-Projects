# Food Delivery Profitability Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and improving the profitability of a food delivery business by evaluating costs, revenues, and implementing new strategies.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

### Working on Discounts
The initial phase involved cleaning and preparing the data, particularly focusing on the discounts offered.

## Cost and Profitability Analysis

### Observations
- The analysis revealed a net loss primarily due to high costs associated with the food delivery operations.
- A significant portion of the costs is attributed to discounts, indicating that current promotional strategies are not effective.

### Visual Analysis
- The visual comparison of total revenue, total costs, and total profit clearly shows that the costs surpass the revenue, leading to a net loss.

## New Strategies

To address the profitability issue, new strategies were proposed. The objective is to find an optimal balance for charging commissions and offering discounts to stay profitable. The key steps include:

1. **Identify a new average commission percentage based on profitable orders.**
2. **Identify a new average discount percentage based on profitable orders.**

These adjustments aim to not only make individual orders profitable but also ensure overall business profitability.

### Calculation and Analysis

- By analyzing only the profitable orders, a new set of averages was found, representing the new strategy.
- For profitable orders, the average commission percentage is higher than the original average, while the average discount percentage is lower.

### Simulating Profitability with New Strategies

- A simulation was conducted to evaluate the potential impact of the new strategies on overall business profitability.

## Interpretation

- The original strategy resulted in a significant portion of orders being unprofitable.
- The new strategy aims to increase the profitability of individual orders, leading to overall business profitability.

## Summary

1. **Cost and Profitability Analysis:** Conducted to understand the current situation, determining if the net loss is due to high costs or low revenue.
2. **Benchmark Analysis:** Analyzed only profitable orders to find new benchmarks for commissions and discounts.
3. **Simulation:** Simulated the profitability with new strategies to assess potential impacts.

By following these steps, the project provides a comprehensive approach to enhancing the profitability of the food delivery business.

## Visualization

Included visualizations:
- Distribution of original and simulated profit distributions.
- Histogram of simulated profits overlaid on KDE plots for deeper insights.
