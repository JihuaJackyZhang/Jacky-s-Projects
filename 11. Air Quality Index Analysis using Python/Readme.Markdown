# Air Quality Index Analysis using Python

This project analyzes the air quality index (AQI) of Delhi using Python. The analysis includes time series analysis of various air pollutants, calculation of AQI, and visualization of trends using the Plotly library.

## Data Source

The data used in this project can be found [here](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2023/09/18/air-quality-index-analysis-using-python/).

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: 
   - `pandas` for data manipulation.
   - `plotly.express` and `plotly.graph_objects` for data visualization.

2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset `delhiaqi.csv`.
   - Convert the `date` column to datetime format.

3. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Plot time series data for each air pollutant using Plotly.
   
4. **Calculation of AQI**:
   - Define AQI breakpoints and corresponding values for PM2.5 and PM10.
   - Calculate AQI for each row in the dataset.

5. **Visualization of AQI Trends**:
   - Plot hourly average AQI.
   - Plot average AQI by day of the week.

6. **Summary**:
   - Insights from the analysis and future directions for using Plotly in place of Matplotlib for interactive visualizations.


## Summary of Findings

- The AQI analysis provided crucial insights into the air quality trends in Delhi.
- The use of Plotly enhanced the visualization with interactive plots.
- Future projects will incorporate Plotly for improved data visualization.
