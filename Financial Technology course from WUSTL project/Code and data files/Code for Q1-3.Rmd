## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Q1
```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the Opportunity insights spending data
OI_spend_city <- read.delim2("OI_spend_city.txt", header = TRUE, sep =",", dec = ".")

# Generate a "date" variable from year, month, day
OI_spend_city$date <- as.Date(with(OI_spend_city, paste(year, month, day, sep="-")), "%Y-%m-%d")

tail(OI_spend_city)

# Transforming growth rate columns to numeric
OI_spend_city$spend_all <- as.numeric(OI_spend_city$spend_all)
OI_spend_city$spend_inperson <- as.numeric(OI_spend_city$spend_inperson)

# Report summary statistics for the growth rates of all spending and in-person spending
summary(OI_spend_city$spend_all)
summary(OI_spend_city$spend_inperson)

# Plot the growth rates of all spending and in-person spending

ggplot(OI_spend_city, aes(x=date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=spend_all, colour="All Spending")) +
  geom_line(aes(y=spend_inperson, colour="In-Person Spending")) +
  labs(title="Growth Rates of All Spending and In-Person Spending", 
       x="Date", y="Growth Rate") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_colour_manual("", 
                      breaks = c("All Spending", "In-Person Spending"),
                      values = c("All Spending"="blue", "In-Person Spending"="red"))
```
## Q2
```{r}
# Add a column that shows "yyyy-mm"
OI_spend_city$date_m <- format(OI_spend_city$date, "%Y-%m")

# Drop the observations that are earlier than January 2019 or later than June 2022
start_date <- as.Date("2019-01-01")
end_date <- as.Date("2022-06-30")
OI_spend_city <- OI_spend_city %>%
  filter(date >= start_date & date <= end_date)

# We can now look at the tail of the data to confirm the changes
tail(OI_spend_city)
```
## Q3
```{r}
# Load the mapping dataset
OI_city_fips <- read.delim2("OI_city_fips.txt", header = TRUE, sep =",", dec = ".")
OI_city_fips
# Merge the datasets by "cityid"
OI_spend_city_merged <- merge(OI_spend_city, OI_city_fips, by = "cityid")

# Check the first few rows of the merged dataset
head(OI_spend_city_merged)
```

```{r}
# For further analysis, we write this as a csv file and use Python to proceed.
write.csv(OI_spend_city_merged, "OI_spend_city_merged.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```
