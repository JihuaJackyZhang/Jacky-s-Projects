# Customer Acquisition Cost Analysis: Process We Can Follow

Customer Acquisition Cost Analysis is a valuable tool for businesses to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of their customer acquisition efforts. It helps make informed decisions about resource allocation and marketing strategies, ultimately contributing to the companyâ€™s growth and profitability.

## Process Overview

Below is the process we can follow for the task of customer acquisition cost analysis as a Data Science professional:

1. Begin by collecting relevant data related to customer acquisition expenses.
2. Segment your customer acquisition costs to understand which channels or strategies are driving customer acquisition.
3. Identify key metrics that will help you calculate CAC.
4. Calculate CAC for each customer acquisition channel or strategy.
5. Analyze and find patterns to optimize your CAC.

## Import Libraries and Load Data

The dataset includes the following columns:

- Customer_ID: Unique identifiers for customers.
- Marketing_Channel: The marketing channel through which customers were acquired (e.g., Email Marketing, Online Ads, Social Media).
- Marketing_Spend: The amount of money spent on marketing for each channel.
- New_Customers: The number of new customers acquired through each marketing channel.

## Calculate Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

### CAC by Marketing Channels

The CAC of Email Marketing is the highest, and Social Media is the lowest.

### Relationship between New Customers and CAC

As marketing efforts become more effective in acquiring customers, the cost per customer acquisition decreases.

### Summary Statistics of All Marketing Channels

By understanding the above summary statistics, you can:

- Use the mean CAC values to compare the average cost of customer acquisition across different marketing channels. For example, if minimizing CAC is a priority, you may want to focus on channels with lower average CAC values.
- Use the standard deviation to assess the consistency of CAC within each channel.

## Conversion Rate by Marketing Channels

The conversion rates of online ads are better than all other channels.

## Break-Even Customers by Marketing Channel

### This Method is Erroneous

The result of Break_Even_Customers is the same as the number of New_Customers.

### The Right Way:

**Break-Even Customers = Marketing_Spend / Average Revenue per Customer (ARPC)**

Since no revenue data is provided, we cannot calculate the Break-Even Customers. However, we could assume different ARPC values for each channel to provide more practice.

### Analysis of Break-Even Customers

Besides calculating Break_Even_Customers using made-up APRC, we also calculated Revenue and Profit. We notice that when Break_Even_Customers is greater than New_Customers, the company is making a profit. Otherwise, it is losing money.

### Compare Actual Customer Acquired (New_Customers) with Break-Even Customers (Break_Even_Customers)

Though the APRC data for each channel is made up, we can still use it to understand the logic of calculating Break-even customers and compare it with actual customers. From the plot, we observe that only the Online Ads channel is profitable, while the other channels are not.

## Summary

This is how we can perform Customer Acquisition Cost Analysis using Python. CAC Analysis helps us assess the efficiency of our marketing strategies and optimize our customer acquisition efforts. By calculating CAC for different marketing channels, we can identify the most cost-effective channels and allocate resources accordingly. Additionally, analyzing conversion rates and break-even customers provides valuable insights into the performance and profitability of our marketing campaigns.
